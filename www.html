            <p>
                HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a language used to create web pages and web applications. It was first created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 as a way to share scientific information with colleagues. HTML has since undergone many revisions and updates, with the latest version being HTML5.
